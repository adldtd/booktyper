# BookTyper

### BookTyper release v0.7.0 GUI
![GUI](/media/gui.png)

An AutoHotkey script that auto-pastes text into Minecraft books and quills. No modding required.

The tool comes with:
- A GUI Interface
- File Select + Text Field
- Custom Pasting Options

## Current Limitations

As of now, this script is only meant to work solely on Java Edition. Bedrock (Windows Edition) does not work, as it has different key bindings than Java. This tool is also meant for vanilla MC worlds; the maximum page limit is 100.

Currently, the tool only supports Minecraft's "default" characters (meaning, the characters found in accented.png, ascii.png, nonlatin_european.png).

## Download

If you don't have AutoHotkey installed, simply download a release from one of the tags, and run the executable. If you want to edit/run the working version, simply run

`git clone https://github.com/adldtd/booktyper`

(NOTE: AutoHotkey is meant solely for Windows machines; the script will not work on Linux.)
