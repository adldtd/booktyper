# BookTyper

An AutoHotKey script that auto-pastes text into Minecraft books and quills. No modding required.

The tool comes with:
- A GUI Interface
- File Select + Text Field
- Custom Pasting Options

## Current Limitations

As of now, this script is only meant to work solely on Java Edition. Bedrock (Windows Edition) does not work, as it has different key bindings than Java.
This tool is also meant for vanilla MC worlds; the maximum page limit is 100.
Currently, the tool only supports Minecraft's "default" characters (meaning, the characters found in accented.png, ascii.png, nonlatin_european.png).

To use the script, simply download the folder and run the program (with AutoHotKey installed).
