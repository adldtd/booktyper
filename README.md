# BookTyper

A simple, AutoHotKey script that auto-pastes text into Minecraft books and quills. No modding required.

The tool comes with:
- A GUI Editor
- File Select + Text Field
- Custom Pasting Options

Currently, the tool only supports Minecraft's "default" characters (meaning, the characters found in accented.png, ascii.png, nonlatin_european.png).

To use the script, simply download the folder and run the program (with AutoHotKey installed).
